App4Debate (AppForDebate, or A4D) is meant to be an application to allow a small group of friends to have productive discussions.

A4D Team: Lukáš Berger (Northeastern University) Jonathan Chiu (Northeastern University) and Chrisantha Perera (MIT).

In general, we intend it to be for groups of <10 people to discuss any topic using reason as a basis for discussion.
We do not implement any logic; this software will currenty be user-curated. Future iterations may consider enforcing reasoning.

To access a specific argument, [TODO]; to start anew, [TODO]

To log in, type your username into the argument you're in. You'll be asked for a password, and if the user is new, an email.
	* We email you only once (for confirmation) unless you forget your password. 

Now that you are logged in, start a discussion or add to it! Choose to agree or disagree with nodes.
You should start on the left and go right, because leftward is more agreed upon, so it should make most sense.
Each Point should consist of about 140 characters which you can see by scrolling over the Point. 
Click the check mark if you agree, or the x mark if you disagree. Simple!

To argue effectively, you should chat with other users and figure out why they agree or disagree with your points.
We can't help you there, the logic of this app has to come from you. We may track score to show who is doing the best...
